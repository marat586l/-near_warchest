This script can dynamically adjust the locked balance of your staking pool, and maintain one seat.
Additionally, it defines the main parameters of the validator такие как seat prices, produced blocks, expected blocks,
gets the current block height and the beginning of the current epoch.
This script run from the terminal where the NEAR node is installed and the validator contract is deployed. To run the script, 
you need to create a directory where to put the stake.bh file, containing the script and config file, where it is written: 
the pool name POOL_ID, the name of the master account WARCHEST_ID, the value that locked balance should not exceed, the value below
which locked balance should not fall, and the value that locked balance should be set to if it is greater or less than these values. 
By default, 180%, 120%, 140% are recorded, respectively, which will be calculated from next seat pric. These values can be changed.
After running, the script determines the main parameters and, if the balance is higher or lower than the set values, issues the command
stake/unstake, respectively. Since the actual decrease/increase in the balance occurs 2 epochs after the command is executed, the script
remembers the block number from which the second epoch will start and re-starts a full check starting from this block. Up to this point 
the script will only identify and print the basic parameters.
Before start script first time needs execute the command chmod ugo+x ./stake.bh. The script is run by a command ./stake.bh from the directory 
where it is located.
The script action is repeated every 30 minutes. You can change this value if you want pressing Ctrl-\.
If you press Ctrl-c, the script writes "Script is finished" and stops working
